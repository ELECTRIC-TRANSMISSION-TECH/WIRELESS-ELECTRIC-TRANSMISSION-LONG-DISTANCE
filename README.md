# WIRELESS-ELECTRIC-TRANSMISSION-LONG-DISTANCE

# history log
implementation  steps:Electrical-Transmission-part implementation: 
1. sender impl
2. receiver  impl

**v0.0.0.1** :combine  the  materials
(aluminum can  and  plastic water bottle)

v0.0.0.1.1:  add the circuit(arduino breadboards jumper-lines)

v0.0.0.1.1 :  add arduino(for  test)

v0.0.0.1.2 :  add  plant

v1.0.0.0.0  :  
Renew  features.
(can , coil for inductor, Iron powder(which  is  originated  by  Hot-pack), magnets  ).  
-zero  volatage, no  current..

**v1.5.0.0.0**
(2025-12-09)
New  construction-way: can  inside   on plastic  bottle and  iron  powder  in  it.  and  inductor  coil  and
copper-line(electrial-line) on  the other can(Tuna  can).

To  be  continued...
--------------------------------
**version  7.0.0.0.0 ** :  reciever  implemantation. Wait... maybe later  2028  or later ...
